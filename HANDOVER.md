## Stack

| Layer | Version | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Next.js | **14.2.35** | Must stay on 14.x — Amplify SSR (WEB_COMPUTE) does not support 15/16 |
| React | 18.3.1 | Must match Next.js 14 |
| Supabase SSR | @supabase/ssr 0.5.2 | Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (new Supabase format) |
| Tailwind | v4 (`@import "tailwindcss"` in globals.css) | `@theme {}` for design tokens |
| Resend | 4.5.1 | Lazy init via `getResend()` — safe when key absent |
| qrcode | 1.5.4 | Real QR code generation in /share |
| Amplify | WEB_COMPUTE platform | Must be WEB_COMPUTE not WEB — static hosting does NOT work |

## Environment Variables (Amplify)

| Variable | Where to get it | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase → Settings → API | `https://vdrrpixgdgnxtvltglul.supabase.co` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Supabase → Connect → Next.js | starts with `sb_publishable_` |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase → Settings → API → Secret key | starts with `sb_secret_` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | this doc | `https://main.d2idx6kv8dvjyf.amplifyapp.com` |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | resend.com → API Keys | ✅ Set in Amplify — using HPS Resend key |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | — | ✅ Set in Amplify — `leadcard@healthprac.com` |
| `PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID` | payfast.co.za dashboard | Add before Session 3 payments work |
| `PAYFAST_MERCHANT_KEY` | payfast.co.za dashboard | Add before Session 3 payments work |
| `PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE` | payfast.co.za dashboard | Add before Session 3 payments work |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID` | same as above | Add before Session 3 payments work |

## Critical Technical Rules

### 1. Never upgrade Next.js beyond 14.x without testing Amplify SSR support first
Amplify's compute runtime lags Next.js releases. Next.js 15/16 caused complete 404s.

### 2. `cookies()` is synchronous in Next.js 14
```typescript
// CORRECT (Next.js 14)
const cookieStore = cookies()

// WRONG — Next.js 15+ only, crashes silently in 14
const cookieStore = await cookies()
```

### 3. Supabase uses new key format
New Supabase projects use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (not the old `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`). Our code reflects this. Never revert to the old name.

### 4. Amplify platform MUST be WEB_COMPUTE
If the app returns 404 and builds succeed, the Amplify app was created as static (`WEB`). Delete and recreate — Amplify auto-detects Next.js SSR on fresh create.

### 5. `params` are synchronous in Next.js 14
```typescript
// CORRECT (Next.js 14)
interface Props { params: { slug: string } }
const { slug } = params

// WRONG — Next.js 15+ only
interface Props { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }
const { slug } = await params
```

### 6. Resend lazy init
`lib/email/resend.ts` uses `getResend()` function — never module-level `new Resend()`. Build-time throw when key absent.

### 7. `serverComponentsExternalPackages`
`resend` + `@react-email/render` are in `experimental.serverComponentsExternalPackages` in `next.config.mjs`. Required to prevent prettier webpack crash.

### 8. ⚠️ Amplify SSR: non-NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars MUST be in next.config.mjs env block
**This is the most common silent failure.** Amplify's SSR Lambda does NOT expose server-side env vars at runtime unless they are explicitly declared in `next.config.mjs`:

```javascript
// next.config.mjs — REQUIRED for Amplify SSR Lambda
env: {
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
  RESEND_API_KEY: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY,
  RESEND_FROM_EMAIL: process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL,
  PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID: process.env.PAYFAST_MERCHANT_ID,
  PAYFAST_MERCHANT_KEY: process.env.PAYFAST_MERCHANT_KEY,
  PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE: process.env.PAYFAST_PASSPHRASE,
}
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are embedded at build time and are always available. Every other server-side secret needs the env block. Missing this causes empty 500 responses with no error log.

### 9. Test auth flows from Amplify URL only — never localhost
Supabase auth emails embed the origin from `emailRedirectTo`. If you sign up from `localhost:3000`, the confirmation email links back to localhost even in production. **Always test from `https://main.d2idx6kv8dvjyf.amplifyapp.com`.**

### 10. Supabase Site URL must match Amplify URL
Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration:
- **Site URL:** `https://main.d2idx6kv8dvjyf.amplifyapp.com`
- **Redirect URLs:** `https://main.d2idx6kv8dvjyf.amplifyapp.com/**`

### 11. Onboarding page must stay outside all route groups
`app/onboarding/page.tsx` — NOT `app/(app)/onboarding/`. The `(app)` layout redirects to `/onboarding` if no subscriber record exists, which creates an infinite redirect loop if onboarding is inside that group.

## Email Architecture

Two separate email systems — don't confuse them:

| System | Sends | Config |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Supabase Auth** | Confirm email, Reset password | Supabase → Auth → Email Templates + SMTP settings |
| **Resend (our code)** | Welcome email, Lead notifications | `lib/email/resend.ts`, `RESEND_API_KEY` env var |

**FROM address:** `leadcard@healthprac.com` — uses the existing `healthprac.com` domain verified in Resend (no new domain needed).

**Supabase auth emails:** Currently using Supabase default templates/SMTP (free plan = ~3 emails/hour limit).  
**⚠️ TODO:** Configure Supabase SMTP → Resend to use branded templates + remove rate limit:
- Host: `smtp.resend.com`, Port: `465`, Username: `resend`, Password: `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Paste branded HTML into Supabase → Auth → Email Templates → Confirm signup + Reset password
- Then re-enable "Confirm email" in Supabase Auth settings

---

## Business Model

| Plan | Price | Cards |
|------|-------|-------|
| Solo | R 69/mo | 1 |
| Small business | R 199/mo | Up to 5 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited |

- 7-day free trial, no card required
- Billing: **PayFast** (South Africa) — redirect flow, MD5-signed URL, ITN webhook
- NFC physical card: R 349/card once-off (coming soon)

---

## PayFast Billing Flow

1. User clicks "Activate" in `/settings`
2. `POST /api/billing/payfast-url` — builds signed redirect URL (MD5 + passphrase)
3. User redirected to `payfast.co.za/eng/process`
4. PayFast posts ITN to `/api/webhooks/payfast` ← **NOT YET BUILT**
5. Webhook updates `subscribers.subscription_status` + `subscribers.plan`

---

## Public Card Flow (6 screens)

`Welcome` (photo, name, contact strip) → `Video` (uploaded or placeholder) → `CTA` (primary action button) → `Form` (JSONB fields + POPIA consent) → `Confirmed` → `Share` (QR + link + vCard)
